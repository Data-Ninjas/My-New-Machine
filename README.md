New-Machine
===========

This repo contains several small PowerShell scripts that utilize Chocolatey and BoxStarter to setup new machines to my preferences. I've found golden images to go out of date extremely quickly, to the point of making it pointless. These scripts help grab the latest versions of many of my daily use applications, so that I can hit the ground running on new machines.

They may or may not be useful for external consumption.
